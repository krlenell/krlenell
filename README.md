### Hello!

I'm Kevin Lenell, a storyteller and educator gone rogue to study programming and web development; hoping to learn and teach as much as is humanly possible.

I like to build React and Node applications which help people learn and develop a more productive workflow.

Currently, I'm caught up in learning a few new technologies, such as Ruby (which I love) and TypeScript before building my next big project.

I currently work as a Teaching Assistant at LearningFuze, and I am open to new opportunities.  

You can see my LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-lenell/
