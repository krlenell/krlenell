## Hello!

I'm Kevin Lenell, a storyteller and educator gone rogue to study programming and web development; hoping to learn and teach as much as is humanly possible.

## About Me

**Hey, this is a bit outdated since I started the working life, but you can read it to learn about where my head was at back in time. I'm hoping to update it soon, but currentlty have a few projects to build.**

I like to build React and Node applications which help people learn and develop a more productive workflow. I've also recently fallen in love with Ruby and TDD, so I am working hard learn these technologies and integrate them with my React frontend experience.

I currently work as a Teaching Assistant at LearningFuze, and I am open to new opportunities.  

I have a few projects working simultaneously.

## Ruby and Rails

As far as projects, I'm working on a Rails Tutor Tracker API both to help manage my tutoring clients and as an opportunity to learn Rails on a deeper level than with my previous projects.  Progress is very slow, on purpose, as I am spending a lot of time trying to learn and incorporate a TDD mindset with RSpec.  

The application repo is [here](https://github.com/krlenell/tutor-tracker-api), but I would recommend viewing [the project page](https://github.com/krlenell/tutor-tracker-api/projects/1) to see what I am up to.  

Currently, progress is a blocked. I recognized that I jumped into a personal project way too early without enough knowledge of Rails proper.  I am returning to curriculum and books for a while until I feel comfortable continuing.

## React and JavaScript

I am currently working on building a small Discord bot to automate some events and channels in a small community discord.  This project is still in the planning phase, but the Repo is [here](https://github.com/krlenell/discord-list-event-bot), and will probably be updated before this description will.

I have previous projects written in JavaScript, some of which are pinned.

## Other stuff

I am writing a few articles which will be featured here when completed. Current topics regard a simple tutorial to immutability in JavaScript using simple ES5 and an article comparing linguistic theory to programming pedagogy.
