### Hello!

I'm Kevin Lenell, a storyteller and educator gone rogue to study programming and web development; hoping to learn and teach as much as is humanly possible.

[![Kevin's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=krlenell&hide=stars&count_private=true&theme=gruvbox&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I like to build React and Node applications which help people learn and develop a more productive workflow.

I currently work as a Teaching Assistant at LearningFuze, and I am open to new opportunities.  

As far as projects, I'm working on a Rails Tutor Tracker API both to help manage my tutoring clients and as an opportunity to learn Rails on a deeper level than with my previous projects.  Progress is very slow, on purpose, as I am spending a lot of time trying to learn and incorporate a TDD mindset with RSpec.  

The application repo is [here](https://github.com/krlenell/tutor-tracker-api), but I would recommend viewing [the project page](https://github.com/krlenell/tutor-tracker-api/projects/1) to see what I am up to.  

You can see my LinkedIn here: [linkedin.com/in/kevin-lenell/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-lenell/)

And here is my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RCvwsgABTuAqoyDN30_gFOxlVgBpcTA3/view?usp=sharing)
